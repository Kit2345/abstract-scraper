['Humanity is now facing what may be the biggest challenge to its existence: irreversible climate change brought about by human activity. Our planet is in a state of emergency, and we only have a short window of time (7–8 years) to enact meaningful change. The goal of this systematic literature review is to summarize the peer-reviewed literature on proposed solutions to climate change in the last 20 years (2002–2022), and to propose a framework for a unified approach to solving this climate change crisis. Solutions reviewed include a transition toward use of renewable energy resources, reduced energy consumption, rethinking the global transport sector, and nature-based solutions. This review highlights one of the most important but overlooked pieces in the puzzle of solving the climate change problem – the gradual shift to a plant-based diet and global phaseout of factory (industrialized animal) farming, the most damaging and prolific form of animal agriculture. The gradual global phaseout of industrialized animal farming can be achieved by increasingly replacing animal meat and other animal products with plant-based products, ending government subsidies for animal-based meat, dairy, and eggs, and initiating taxes on such products. Failure to act will ultimately result in a scenario of irreversible climate change with widespread famine and disease, global devastation, climate refugees, and warfare. We therefore suggest an “All Life” approach, invoking the interconnectedness of all life forms on our planet. The logistics for achieving this include a global standardization of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) or similar measures and the introduction of a regulatory body for verification of such measures. These approaches will help deliver environmental and sustainability benefits for our planet far beyond an immediate reduction in global warming.', 
'This paper focuses on climate anxiety and its role in the psychology of climate change, compared with responses to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Four psychological hypotheses for why we do not act on climate change will be reviewed, and the role of anxiety for each, as well as potential solutions. Different types of climate anxiety both inside and outside the clinic will be explored, along with associated defence mechanisms and treatment.', 
"We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S. This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2\xa0K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5\xa0K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density function (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult‐to‐quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66% range is 2.6–3.9\xa0K for our Baseline calculation and remains within 2.3–4.5\xa0K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5–95% ranges are 2.3–4.7\xa0K, bounded by 2.0–5.7\xa0K (although such high‐confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing‐feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.", 
'Climate change has been shown to be directly linked to multiple physiological sequelae and to impact health consequences. However, the impact of climate change on mental health globally, particularly among vulnerable populations, is less well understood.']

'The objective of this work was to analyze all important evidence relevant to climate sensitivity and use that evidence to draw conclusions about the probabilities of various values of the sensitivity. In so doing we have examined the interdependence of different lines of evidence and the possibility that structural or other flaws in our understanding might affect conclusions or lead to overconfidence. There are subjective elements to such an exercise, but there are also objective ones—in particular, enforcing mathematical rules of probability to ensure that our beliefs about climate sensitivity are internally consistent and consistent with our beliefs about the individual pieces of evidence.', 
'This article provides a stocktake of the adaptation literature between 2013 and 2019 to better understand how adaptation responses affect risk under the particularly challenging conditions of compound climate events. Across 39 countries, 45 response types to compound hazards display anticipatory (9%), reactive (33%), and maladaptive (41%) characteristics, as well as hard (18%) and soft (68%) limits to adaptation. Low income, food insecurity, and access to institutional resources and finance are the most prominent of 23 vulnerabilities observed to negatively affect responses. Risk for food security, health, livelihoods, and economic outputs are commonly associated risks driving responses. Narrow geographical and sectoral foci of the literature highlight important conceptual, sectoral, and geographic areas for future research to better understand the way responses shape risk. When responses are integrated within climate risk assessment and management, there is greater potential to advance the urgency of response and safeguards for the most vulnerable.',

'The documented mental health effects of climate change among vulnerable populations globally in the retrieved results were numerous. Depression and suicide were frequently observed in the articles retrieved. For example, patterns of climate change have exacerbated farmers’ perceived risk of depression and suicide [26], marginalized groups had higher levels of suicidal ideation six months after severe flooding [51]. Additionally, results show increased prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide plans [39]. Of note, people impacted by climate change who experience Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) may not benefit from normal course of treatment for this diagnosis [52]. ‘Eco-anxiety’ and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also well-documented in the results. PTSD has been shown to be a direct effect of acute weather events [40], and traumatic exposure to major storms is predictor for multiple mental health impacts including substance use and dependence [53], particularly among people who already belong to marginalized groups [51]. Anxiety (and anxiety-mood) disorders both at baseline and in the follow up surveys among New Orleans residents following Hurricane Katrina were considerably higher than those found in previous surveys of mental illness after natural disasters in the US [39].']
